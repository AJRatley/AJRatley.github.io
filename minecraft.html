<h1>Minecraft Art</h1>
<p>For this project we were tasking with creating art in a virtual space (sandbox environment) and we chose to experiment with Minecraft. We needed to create an object that was significant to us or our culture; and growing up in England, Harry Potter was a major part of everyone's childhood. Therefore I decided to recreate the Knight bus, using: purple, white, orange and black wool; a birch door; and glass panels.
