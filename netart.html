<h1>Net.Art</h1>
<p>The aim of this project was to learn how to write code in html. We created a website using minimum 10 pages and had to create a make your own adventure game. I chose to do a lost in the woods story that had 5 different outcomes based on what choices the player made. I learnt how to include: images, links, headings, paragraphs, embedded links, links within pictures, shapes within pictures, breaks etc. I now feel confident creating basic websites from scratch using html.
