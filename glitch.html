<h1>Glitch Art</h1>
<p>The topic of my image series is breaking down homophobia. I've taken images of homophobic rallies, protests and signs; and then glitched them to break the message. My first three images are glitched using data moshing. For my first image I used the reverb effect which turned a lot of the colour in the image to white accept for the bright rainbow in the pride flag, emphasising it's importance in this image and the world. For image 2 I used the echo effect which made the plain sections of the image colourful, putting rainbow into the image, indirectly fighting the homophobia. I used the effect wahwah in image 3  that took out all the colour and slightly distorted the image, showing homophobia can take all the colour and joy from the world.  For my final image I used data bending, and placed Hilary Clintons LGBTQ rights speech into the html of the file, showing speaking out on equal rights can break down homophobia to nothing (like the picture becoming illegible.)</a></p>
