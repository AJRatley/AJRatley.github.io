<h1>Meme Mashup</h1>
<p>The aim of this task was to take multiple images or memes that had already embedded meanings and combine them to create a new meaning. I combined the disaster girl meme (an image of a girl looking smugly at the camera with a house burning down behind her) with an image of Guy Fawkes (an English criminal who plotted to blow up the houses of parliament.) To combine these images further, I included modern features such as sunglasses and a piece sign to juxtapose the 1600's theme which I incorporated with the barrel of gunpowder and the old England judges wigs. I used colour overlay with a sheer opacity to make sure the skin colours matched and a gaussian blur to blend everything together due to the background of the meme originally being very blurred.
