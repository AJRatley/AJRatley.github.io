<p class="lead text-center">Animation is a skill i have worked on improving over the past year and this is my first proper mini animation project.
  I drew the features in Adobe Illustrator and then used multiple layers and compostitons to create the animation.
  I used trim paths, transformations and groups to create the final video.</p></div>

<p class="lead text-center">Once I had learnt the basics from the task above, I created a self playing game aniamtion of a cinema trip simulator.
I did the same process as as the video above but to a more complex level, drawing the images in Illustrator and bringing them into after effects to edit.
Although it looks more complex, I used the same transformations to create this animation.</p></div>

<p class="lead text-center">This is my first animation I created for a client. The DH Lawrence birthplace museum required me and a group of 3 other girls to create 
an animation about the travelling he did throughout his life. My job was producer and coordinator, script writer and animator. The other girls in the group
drew the assets such as the map and transport, recorded the voiceover, found copywrite free sound effects, etc. I used my prior knowledge to do this animation task
but also completed a LinkedIn learning on after effects to refresh my memory. </p></div>
