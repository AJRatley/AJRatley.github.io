<h1 class="display-2">Live Action Video</h1>
<p class="lead text-center">The main focus of my degree is Live Action Video. There is a heavy focus on filming video and audio and editing them.
Because of this, I have been trained on canon and sony cameras, zoom recorders, osmo pockets, blackmagic cameras and more. I have also been taught how to use Premier Pro and Audition to a intermediate level for this. 
I have attached some videos below, my role in group projects is usually producers and editor rather than physically handleing cameras because it is what I prefer, but in solo projects like the video below, I completed all the processes independently. </p></div>

  <div class="col-sm-6"> <p class="lead text-center"> This was a video project was a 30 second montage set to represent the theme of the passing of time. 
  I chose to link this to the decay of nature, as it is something where we can visibally see time passing. 
  I used a vase of roses as my nature element because these can represent different things to different people such as love and loss; and my aim with this piece was to create an emotional response from the audience.  </p>
